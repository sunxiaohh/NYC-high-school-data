# Data exploration for NYC- high - school- data 
## This project is for my curisoity about whether SAT is fair and what might affect sat score. 
## This is an end-to-end project (not finished yet) for fun
   ### Acquired data from open sources (NYC Open data)and process them. （Since I could acquire these data easily, I will focus on the New York area）
   ### This prject contains how to acquire real world data, data preprocessing, data exploration, visualization and analysis, modeling for prediction.
   ### I used Random Forest to select important features therefore I could know which feature affects more
   ### I did this project with many pitfalls. But I would perfect this later gradually with time and with my increasing knowledge and skills. 
   
# Hope you enjoy my work too!

## This is an end-to-end project (not finished yet) for fun
   ### Acquired data from open sources and process them.
   ### Have done exploration and analysis
   ### In the future, I will use classification algorithm like decision trees or random forest to predict which schools in New York City would have better performance in the SAT score
